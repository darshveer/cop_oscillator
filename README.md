# COP Oscillator: Ring Oscillator-Based Ising Solver

A VLSI implementation of a probabilistic compute fabric using coupled ring oscillators to solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) such as the Max-Cut problem.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements an **Ising computer** in 65nm CMOS technology using a network of coupled ring oscillators (ROSCs) to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Unlike traditional von Neumann architectures and quantum annealing approaches, this system operates at room temperature and offers a scalable, energy-efficient alternative for solving optimization problems.

### Key Innovation

The core innovation maps the **Ising Hamiltonian** to circuit dynamics:
- Each ring oscillator represents a spin variable (si ∈ {-1, +1})
- Oscillator phase represents spin state (in-phase → same state, 180° out-of-phase → opposite state)
- Coupling between oscillators is implemented using back-to-back inverters (B2B inverters)
- The system naturally evolves to minimize the Hamiltonian energy: **Hs = Σ Jij·si·sj**

## 🚀 Workflow

The complete simulation pipeline follows this sequence:

```
planar.py 
   ↓ (generates random graph & enables)
testbench.cir + network_4_4.subckt
   ↓ (NGspice transient analysis)
nodes.csv (raw voltage/time data)
   ↓ (Grouper.m - edge detection & phase mapping)
signum_output.csv (binary spin states)
   ↓ (visualize_edges.py)
Final Result Plot (colored node graph)
```



### Step-by-Step Usage

1. **Generate Test Case:**
   ```bash
   python3 planar.py
   ```
   - Creates random planar graph mapped to hexagonal grid
   - Computes optimal Max-Cut solution (brute-force verification)
   - Generates `testbench.cir` with enable signals

2. **Run Simulation:**
   ```bash
   ngspice testbench.cir
   ```
   - Transient analysis: 5 seconds, 0.1ns time steps
   - Outputs voltage waveforms to `nodes.csv`

3. **Process Results:**
   ```bash
   matlab < Grouper.m
   ```
   - Detects rising edges in oscillator outputs
   - Computes relative phase differences
   - Discretizes to binary states using signum function
   - Generates `signum_output.csv`

4. **Visualize Solution:**
   ```bash
   python3 visualize_edges.py
   ```
   - Reconstructs graph topology from enables
   - Colors nodes: Red (-1) / Blue (+1)
   - Plots final Max-Cut partition

5. **Full Automation:**
   ```bash
   ./run_sim.sh
   ```
   - Executes complete workflow in sequence

## 📊 Results and Performance

- **Accuracy Range:** 65% - 100%
- **Test Cases:** 20 independent runs
- **Success Rate:** Highly variable due to lack of thermal noise

### Example Result - Max-Cut Solution

The following example demonstrates a successful solution with 100% accuracy on a graph with Max-Cut value of 11:

![Example Max-Cut problem graph with solution partition](./Photos/Figure_19.png)

The graph is partitioned into two sets:
- **Red nodes** represent spin state -1
- **Blue nodes** represent spin state +1
- **Edges between partitions** contribute to Max-Cut value (11 in this case)

### Probabilistic Behavior

The system exhibits probabilistic operation through:
- Inherent system noise and process variation
- Escape from local minima to explore energy landscape
- Multiple stable states achievable with same configuration

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Current Implementation

1. **Array Size:** Currently limited to 4×4 due to:
   - Python recursion depth constraints
   - Computational resource limits
   - Future work: Optimize code for 28×20 array (as in paper)

2. **Thermal Noise:** Not simulated due to:
   - Digital-only PDK limitations
   - NGspice constraints
   - Solution: Migrate to SKY130 PDK or Cadence tools

3. **Deterministic Output:** Lack of noise causes:
   - Same output for identical configurations
   - Cannot perform Monte-Carlo analysis
   - No stochastic exploration of solution space
